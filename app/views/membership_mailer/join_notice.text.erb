Using Threadable is easy! Any email you send to:

Threadable makes it easy for groups of people to work together.
Think of it like a forum that lives in your inbox. Or, an old-school mailing list, but better!

<% unless @recipient.web_enabled? %>
Threadable also has a web view, which lets you see the entire message archive, view the
member roster, and organize conversations! Click here to set up a password for
