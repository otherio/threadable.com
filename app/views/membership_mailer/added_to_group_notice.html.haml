  I added you to the
  = link_to @group.name, conversations_url(@organization, @group)
  group in the
  = link_to @organization.name, conversations_url(@organization, 'my')
  organization on Threadable.

%p
  This means that messages sent to
  = mail_to @group.email_address, @group.email_address
  will now be sent to your inbox.

%p
  If you don't want to be in the
  = link_to @group.name, conversations_url(@organization, @group)
  group, you can
  = link_to 'click here to leave', email_action_link(@group, @recipient, "leave")

%p
  To view this group in the web
  = link_to 'click here', conversations_url(@organization, @group)
