I removed you from the <%= @group.name %> group in the
"<%= @organization.name %>" organization on Threadable.

This means that conversations and tasks created in this group will no
longer be sent to your email, but you can still access them on Threadable.

If you don't want that, you can change your membership settings here:

<%= group_members_url(@organization, @group) %>

You can see the current conversations and tasks in this group here:
<%= conversations_url(@organization, @group) %>
