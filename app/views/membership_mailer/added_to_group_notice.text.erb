I added you to the <%= @group.name %> group in the
"<%= @organization.name %>" organization on Threadable.

This means that messages sent to:

  <%= @group.email_address %>

will now be sent to your inbox.


If you don't want to be in the <%= @group.name %> group,
you can leave by going to the following url:

  <%= email_action_link(@group, @recipient, "leave") %>

To view this group on the web, click here:

  <%= conversations_url(@organization, @group) %>
