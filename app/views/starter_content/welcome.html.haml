  Hi. I'm Ian, Threadable co-founder. Thanks for choosing us!

%p
  Threadable is a better mailing list, specifically designed to make working
  together with people more awesome.

%p
  If you've never used a mailing list before, it's super easy. Any email you
  send to
  = organization.email_address
  will be delivered to all of the members of
  = organization.name

%p
  Mailing lists have been around a long time so you've probably used one
  before, but we're a little different. Over the next few days, I'll send
  your group some tips for how to use Threadable to stay organized.

%p
  Also, note that Threadable is currently in a preview release, under very
  active development. If you see something that doesn't work for you, or if
  you think of anything you wish your group email did, let us know! You can
  email me personally at ian@threadable.com, or you can reach the whole
  team at support@threadable.com.
