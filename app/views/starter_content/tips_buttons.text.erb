Messages sent through Threadable arrive with some handy links at the bottom.
If you're reading this in your inbox, you should see them at the end of this
message.

Here's what they do:

Web view: Lets you view the conversation on the Threadable website.
Mute: Click this to receive no further messages in a conversation.
New conversation: Creates a new message to <%= organization.email_address %>
New task: Creates a new task message to <%= organization.task_email_address %>

Why is this awesome? Here's one example:

From time to time, I'll reply to this thread with tips on how to get the most
out of Threadable. If you'd prefer not to receive these messages, simply click
the "Mute" link below. You’ll still be able to read new tips on the Threadable
website (just click the "Web view" link) but you’ll have one less conversation
to deal with in your inbox. Easy!

Note: In order for them to function, the Web view and Mute links both
require you to have created a password and be logged into the Threadable
website. If you haven't created your password yet, you can do so at
