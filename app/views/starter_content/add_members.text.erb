See that checkbox in the subject? That means this is a task thread.

Tasks in Threadable are just like conversations, only with some additional
information like who's doing them and whether or not they're done yet.
Because tasks show up right in your inbox it’s easy for everyone to stay
up to date about what needs to get done.

Of course, before people in <%= organization.name %> can receive mail
from Threadable, you’ll need to <% if organization.trusted? %>add<% else %>invite<% end %> them. Here's how:

  1. Go to the Threadable website.
  2. Click on the triangle to the right of your organization's name.
  3. Click on "Members" to see a list of your organization's current
     members.
  4. Click on "Add member", located at the top of the member list.
  5. A welcome message will appear. Enter the new member's name and email
     address, then click "Add member & send welcome message".

Each member you add will receive an email from you, explaining that you've
added them to the <%=organization.name%> organization on
Threadable.

<% if organization.trusted? %>
(You can also include a personal comment explaining what's up, which is
generally the friendly thing to do, especially if the recipient doesn't
already know about Threadable.)

Note that once added, new members will immediately be able to send and
receive messages on Threadable.
<% else %>
Note that before they can send and receive messages on Threadable, new
members will need to click on the link in their invitation email.
<% end %>
