Sometimes, conversations get big. For example, once I was on a mailing list
where people started talking about throwing a party. Pretty soon, there were
threads for where to get balloons, whose house had the best sound system, and
where to get dinner beforehand. Unfortunately, half the people on the list
were unable to attend.

Whenever this happens, your team is presented with a catch-22. Do you keep the
conversation on the list, and risk annoying people with mail they don't need?
What if they unsubscribe, or just filter the list into a box they never check?
Or, do you make a new list, wait for everyone to subscribe, and deal with the
confusion of restarting all the threads.

With Threadable, you don't have to choose. You can create groups inside your
Threadable organization (for example, "Party"). Then, you can move all the
existing conversations into the new groups. Members of the Party group get to
keep writing back to the same threads as before, uninterrupted. Everyone else
stops receiving new messages, but can always find them on the web.

You already have one group in your threadable, called Social. You can write to
it at social@<%=organization.slug%>.threadable.com.

Groups are awesome because:

  1. Making a group isn't like making a new mailing list. You can move
  conversations into and out of groups after they start.

  2. Anyone can make a group. This empowers the team to organize its own
  communication, as the need arises. Your teammates can control the flow of
  information collaboratively, making sure people are in the loop when they
  need to be, but they aren't bothered by unnecessary messages.

  3. Conversations can even belong to multiple groups. Just CC a group to add
  it, or do it on the web.

The result is that you don't have to anticipate the needs of your team, and
make a bunch of groups because you think you'll need them. Let conversations
happen, and when enough momentum builds around an idea that it needs to be
split off into its own group, you can move it without interrupting the flow.

To make a new group:

  1. Go to the Threadable website.

  2. Click on the triangle to the right of your organization's name.

  3. Click on "Create New Group"
