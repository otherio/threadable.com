          One conversation can be about multiple things. How do you keep focus on what you need to?

          Threadable lets you slice and dice conversations across an organization, creating impromptu groups on the fly for specific topics without interrupting discussions after they start.

        %p
          How many times have you tried to get a team on board a new project management tool, only to have it languish half-used and barely-updated?

          Use Threadable to meet your team where they are: their inboxes. Keep everyone engaged and on the same page whether they're on desktops or mobile devices.

        %p
          Sometimes you need to take a step back and see where everyone is in a conversation: what needs resolving, and who's doing what?

          With Threadable, you can create, assign, and track tasks from your inbox, but you don't have to. Use the web view to get an overview, make changes, and give updates to projects and discussions in flight.

        %div
          In Threadable, anyone can move any conversation into a group of users -- an existing one, or one they can create on the fly (Social, West Coast, Rails devs, People with dogs) -- even after the discussion's already started. Groups make instant, collaborative email filtering possible, letting you and everyone else focus on what you need to hear about.

          With Threadable, you can create, assign, and track tasks from your inbox without any extensions to download or software to install. Anyone on your team can go from "Hey, I'll do that" to actually creating and claiming a task using nothing but their existing email, whether they're at their desk or on a mobile device.

          If you're already using Trello or Pivotal Tracker, Threadable lets you make and receive comments and updates to cards from your email. Increase everyone's engagement with already-established tools instantly, and make your Trello comments searchable from within your own inbox.
