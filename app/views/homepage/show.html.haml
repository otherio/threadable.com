        %div
          Groups let your team categorize conversations on-the-fly, as things develop. No more broken reply-all chains, worrying about who'll need to get which messages, or starting a new list and breaking the flow of conversation for a week. Anyone in your organization can make a new group. You can join or leave groups any time, controlling the flow of information that's relevant to you. Even better, you can move a conversation into a group after it's started. So, that thread about the ski trip being sent to the whole company is no longer a problem.

          One click mute from any email thread stops delivery in its tracks. Not just in one client, but in all of them. Want to check back in? The website has a rich, fully searchable archive of every conversation, in every group, so it's easy to get caught up and reply. You can even use Groups as collaborative mail filters, relying on the knowledge of the team to put all mail in it's right place.
