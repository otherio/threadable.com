        %div
          How many times have you tried to get a team on board a new project management tool, only to have it languish
          half-used and barely-updated? Use Threadable to meet your team where they're at: their inboxes. Keep everyone
          engaged and on the same page whether they're on desktops or mobile devices.

        .h2 More signal, less noise
        %div
          Groups let your team categorize conversations on-the-fly, as things develop. No more broken reply-all chains,
          or starting a new list and breaking the flow of conversation for a week. Anyone in your organization can make
          a new group. You can join or leave groups any time, controlling the flow of information that's relevant to you.
          Even better, you can move a conversation into a group <em>after it's started.</em> So, that thread about the
          ski trip being sent to the whole company is no longer a problem.

        %div
          One click mute from any email thread stops delivery in its tracks. Not just in one client, but in all of them.
          Want to check back in? The website has a rich, fully searchable archive of every conversation, in every
          group, so it's easy to stay connected with your team. You can even use Groups as collaborative mail filters,
          relying on the wisdom of the team to put all mail in its right place.

        .h2 Convenient, simple integrations
        %div
          Keep all your communications in one place, without changing your toolset. Pull comment streams from the tools
          you already use and give them new life as threaded email discussions. Search, filter, reply, and subscribe
          using one easy interface. Get your whole team engaged with your existing tools.

        %div
          Better than filters: process your email in realtime using your own code. Reformat, store, notify, slice and
          dice, but leave all the messy parsing and delivery to us.

        %div
          For social productivity to work, communication is key. Keep whole teams engaged effortlessly by using the
          inbox the way people expect. In less time than building simple email notifications, you can be using email as
          a full-featured platform for delivering real value to your users. Focus on your app's special sauce, and let
          Threadable make your email sing.
