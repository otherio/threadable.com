        %div
          Your team is creative. Let them approach new challenges independently.
          Anyone on the team can create a new groupâ€”for a project, a sub-team, a department, anything!
          Members-only, or shared with everyone.
        %br
          Move a conversation from one group to another,
          %span.hype
            even after it's started.
          Don't anticipate your team's needs. Instead, create a group after discussion gains momentum.
          It's a whole new way of working with email.

          Threadable gives you unprecedented control over what's in your inbox.
          You can receive just the first message of each conversation, then follow the ones that look interesting.
          Or, get a summary of a whole group each day, and choose the threads you want delivered.
        %br
          And if there's just one conversation you don't need, one-click mute gets it out of your way.
          Not just in one client, but in all of them.

          Threadable keeps track of which messages you've received.
          If you show up late to the party, just sync the older messages right into your inbox.
          Or, read them in your browser using Threadable's responsive, fully-searchable web app.
