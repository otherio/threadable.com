    So on the kayak, we use two layers of carbon plus some batting on the bottom,
    and carbon/glass on the sides. Looking at the drawings on your blog, it seems
    like the top of the bodywork has a pretty wide unsupported area. In that case,
    I''d go for the carbon/glass, even though it''s a little heavier. You could also
    use single layers of carbon and back it with some rod or some aluminum to reduce
    flexing and make it less likely to crack.

    Good luck!
