    So on the kayak, we use two layers of carbon plus some batting on the bottom,
    and carbon/glass on the sides. Looking at the drawings on your blog, it seems
    like the top of the bodywork has a pretty wide unsupported area. In that case,
    I''d go for the carbon/glass, even though it''s a little heavier. You could also
    use single layers of carbon and back it with some rod or some aluminum to reduce
    flexing and make it less likely to crack.

    Good luck!

    Andy'

  body_plain: Wow, thanks Andy! Super helpful. I think we'll just go for the carbon/glass
    like you suggested, since we're under weight on the wheels anyway.

  body_plain: This turned out super awesome! Yan and Bethany and I stayed til 8pm
    doing the layup and fitting everything on the vacuum table. The pieces are curing
    in the oven now, but we got some photos of them before they went in. Bethany got
    epoxy everywhere! It was pretty funny.
